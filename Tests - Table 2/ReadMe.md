## Files in this folder

* [`ReadMe.md`](ReadMe.md): This file.

* [`Results.xlsx`](Results.xlsx): Detailed results of all the performed computational experiments.

Jupyter notebooks with code for the Graph Partitioning Problem in Connected Components with Minimum Size Constraints. The Gurobi package is needed to test the code for the linear models. The notebooks are presented _as it is_.

* [`M1_VI.py`](M1_VI.py): First MIP model (M<sub>1</sub>) with valid inequalities (Theorems 2 to 9).
 Second MIP model (M<sub>2</sub>).
* [`M2_VI.py`](M2_VI.py): Second MIP model (M<sub>2</sub>) with valid inequalities (Theorems 2 to 9).
* [`CG_VIs_30.py`](CG_VIs_30.py): Column Generation model (M<sub>3</sub>) with Columns Heuristic (Algorithm 1) and Cuts (Theorems 12 & 13).
